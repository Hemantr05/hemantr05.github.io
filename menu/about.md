title: Hello World!

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Glib.ai, with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology.<br>
I am inclined towards research in fields pertaining to computer vision and natural language understanding, although I am equally fascinated with anything related to AI-driven tech in general. Gotten my hands dirty with some projects and internships alongside publishing a few research papers in presumably well-known journals in a bid to further my knowledge.
