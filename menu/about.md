title: Hello World!

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Glib.ai, with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineer from Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology.
I am inclined towards research in fields pertaining to computer vision and natural language processing, although I am equally fascinated with anything related to Computers in general. Have done some projects and internships alongside published research papers in a few reputed journals (namely, springer and journal for critical review to name a few) in a bid to further my knowledge.
